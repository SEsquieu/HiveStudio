# Hive Studio

**Hive Studio** is the visual task builder for **HiveOS**, a modular autonomy orchestration platform for real-world agents.

This tool lets you:
- Build YAML task files visually with a node-based editor
- Export tasks directly to HiveOS
- Simulate logic flows, conditionals, and branching
- Define agent capabilities, TTLs, and task structure with no coding required

## üß™ Tinker-Friendly Preview (Limited)

A soft preview is live! This is a working testbed for HiveOS runtime orchestration with session-based isolation. The core is running on my laptop, in my kitchen, so play nice!

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  
Sessions automatically expire **after 1 hour** of uptime. If your session becomes stale, you may need to refresh and create a new one to resume testing.

## Coming Soon üöß

The following features are actively being developed and will be rolled out soon:

- **Local session export/import**: Save and reload your entire HiveOS session with agents, tasks, and zones.
- **Per-session history tracking**: Session logs and past task snapshots for persistent user experience.
- **Session continuity tools**: Seamless reconnection and continuation between runtime sessions.

## About HiveOS

HiveOS is a hardware-agnostic orchestration layer for autonomous systems. It breaks down complex behavior into composable, task-driven units and coordinates them across agents. 

Stay tuned for more!
